It may be sufficient to simply randomly scatter them. Given a competent Node Activation Learner, it may be possible to prune randomly scattered HLN's bassed on if they are ever activated.

Scatter HLN's connected to ground nodes evenly around the ground-node-space such that there are many fewer HLN's than ground nodes, these HLN's then become the tier 1 HLN's. tier 1 HLN's can be connected to make tier 2 HLN's, again such that there are fewer tier 2 than tier 1 nodes.\n",

By means of node propagation, information could flow upwards from the ground nodes, to this output node. This node could then be trained to output the answer to a speccific type/format of query. As the information passes up this heirarchy it gets dimensionally reduced since each successive tier has fewer nodes. Pairing this dimensional reduction with an attention based summarisation which is query aware, each successive layer could integrate information from larger and larger chunks of the knowledge graph, while extracting and focusing the information relevant to the query. \n",

Paths to different output nodes could diverge at different tiers of the heirarchy, meaning output nodes may share larger sections of their heirarchy with some output nodes than others. Output nodes which represent more similar tasks/query types could branch off later, thereby sharing more of the heirarchy.  This is similar to an idea in transfer learning whereby the less abstractly related your new goal is, the more layers you have to peel off the pretrained model.\n",

    "A node is active when it participates in the information propagation process. A simple activation method is boolean - the node either broadcasts and receives information, or it doesn't. A coninuous activation level could allow for certain nodes to be activated more than others, and even for nodes to be acivated in different ways. Nodes could contain a continuous activation number for each state type that they have, such that whenever a particular state vector gets used in the reasoning process it is multiplied by activation number. In this way the activation number would either boost or dampen or turn off the signal coming from each nodes' states\n",

    "# Node Activation Learner (NAL)\n",
    "For a knowledge base with many more fact than a particular task requires, it is undesirable for the entire set of the graph's nodes to activate right from the beginning.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A learned mechanism to activate a set of starting nodes which begin the propagation process may be helpful. If informed by the query, this selection mechanism could learn to activate specific nodes which it beleives are relevant to answering the given question. Once nodes are activated, they can activate their neighbours, possibly again employing the selector to classify the neighbouring nodes as neccesary for activation or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a selector would likely require a reinforcement learner to practice answering quetions from a knowledge base. Here the actions would be to activate or not activate each of the nodes, ideally at the granularity of SLN's to reduce the node count. The reward would be the accuracy of the question answering process.\n",

A naive explainer may simply pluck the statements out which contain the question words and the proposed answer. A more sophisticated explainer may make use of node activation. Assuming a competent NAL, the nodes which are most active would be the most relevant to the reasoning process, and answering the question. Given these node activations, the statements which contain words represented by the most active nodes can be extracted and presented. \n",
