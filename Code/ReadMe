Todo:
* change graph encoding to inherit Batch instead of Data
* bug in graph construction - word to token not getting every link
* wire up the new module system to be configurable
    * should be able to use multiple message modules

* Graph embedder
     * query aware embeddings
     * positional encodings
     * make fine tuning the contextual embedder optional
     * edge feature encodings. an embedder for subtype info
     * more sophisticated attentive summarisation, possibly utilising sliding window att to pretransform a sequence
        before using self attentive pooling

* Graph construction
     * add support for candidate entity nodes
     * node filters to allow for word nodes be filtered by query words
     * swap out spacy coref for something better
     * AMR
     * decouple with spacy tokens
     * make type a param not class type. when special classes are created - they pass a rep of their class type to type
        * this allows for generic edges and nodes which can still be given distinct types/subtypes

* GNNs
    * rework layer system to use message/aggregate/update modules which can be swapped around
    * Edge features
         * rework edge type switching to use configurable edge groups
              * separate options for type, subtype, direction
              * edge features can be incorporated via embed and concat | or layer switching
              * can declare exceptions to these rules eg switch(type, subtype) + embed(QueryEdge:"sent2sent")
         * fine tunable edge feature embedder
            * append edge features/embeddings to message along feature dim
         * config system to group edge types/ features.
         * make generic heirarchical layer switching module
            * can be reused for task switching later
         * for layer switching, define global/dependant layer-size ratio system.
            Total bandwidth is given, and preserved, but split among global and dependant. eg g:0.8,d:0.2
         * if layer switching is on for multiple feature levels eg type and subtype - switching must be heirarchical

     * node type switches update function much like edge type switches message function

* config summary graphs
    * graph construction summary graphs
        * can include embedding information
    * gnn layer switching summary graphs
    * gnn summary graph which doesn't include switching info. just layers, types, sizes. like cdn diagram




* Make bert tokeniser cased
* add in returning edges for the directed edges

NLP Libs:
Spacy - ineffective
StanfordNLP python wrapper has no coref
