Todo:
1: make option to save embeddings as id's relative to a specific encoder eg BERT\
2. rework stateset to not be used during dataset construction, but booted up during gnn run on the fly.
    this way datasets and states can be completely decoupled
3: allow for different state types and shapes to be saved to a geometric graph
4: map back to node type during gnn passes - save type:id mappings per datsaset
5: implement edge type saving and remapping
6: create a edge type: layer mapper
7: add support for candidate and query entity nodes
8: swap out spacy coref for something better
9: re-implement the GraphLayer/module system
